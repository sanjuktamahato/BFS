# BFS
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level, starting from a chosen source node. It uses a queue to visit all neighbors before moving deeper, ensuring the shortest path in unweighted graphs. BFS is widely used in networking, AI, and solving puzzles.
